<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Krishna Sharma, a first-year B.Tech student at Sharda University with a keen interest in technology and innovation. As I begin my journey in the world of engineering, I’m excited to explore new ideas, build practical skills, and work on projects that challenge and inspire me.</p>

 <p> I'm passionate about learning programming, solving problems, and understanding how technology can be used to make life better. This portfolio is my first step toward building a strong foundation and sharing my progress along the way.</p>
   
 <p> Outside of academics, I enjoy [mention a hobby or interest, e.g., playing chess, listening to music, or exploring new gadgets], and I'm always open to learning something new.</p>
  
 <p>Thanks for visiting—I'm just getting started, and there's a lot more to come!</p>
